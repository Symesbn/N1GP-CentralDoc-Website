<p>Thank you for taking the time to read our rules.</p>

<p>The N1GP strives to be a safe and inclusive community, so we expect our members to actively uphold these rules.</p>

<p>The severity of warnings and bans are decided at the discretion of moderators. Bans are issued to people who demonstrate that they're unwilling to follow the rules.<br>
	Temporary bans are issued as corrective action, with the expectation that members will learn and improve. Permanent bans are a last resort and apply to both the discord server and all N1GP hosted events.</p>
	
<h2>Core Rules</h2>

<ol>
	<li>The N1 Grand Prix Discord server is a SFW Server. Any NSFW content will be removed.</li>
	<li>Direct links to ROMs (Including 3DS CIAs or 3dsx files), Android APKs that require a Purchase for full functionality, and pirated/cracked software (Including but not limited to games and programs) directly or indirectly, are strictly prohibited.</li>
	<li>No referral or malicious links are allowed.  Please do not broadcast other Discord servers, Kickstarter or other Crowdfunding campaigns without consulting Moderators first. Unauthorized solicitations are not welcome and will be deleted.</li>
	<li>Please respect the privacy of the members of the community. Do not share another members’ personal information without prior privately-obtained consent. This includes (but is not limited to) First and/or Last names, physical locations, phone numbers, or Social Media links (ex. Personal Facebook page).<br>
		Violating this rule will result in corrective action up to and including a ban depending on the severity of the breach of information.</li>
	<li>Ban evasion (defined as someone creating new accounts to circumvent bans) is not allowed.</li>
	<li>N1GP has a zero-tolerance policy against slurs, inflammatory content, implied or direct sexism,  discriminatory language, depiction of harm to self or others, or objectional content.  We strive to be an inclusive and welcoming community and this conduct is not welcome.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>Etiquette Rules</h2>

<ol>
	<li>N1GP has multiple channels for all sorts of discussions. In an effort to prevent derailing of conversation in these rooms, we’d like to ask that you ensure that your conversations remain on-topic for the room you are in.<br>
		Excessive improper discussion in certain channels, such as #strategies, may subject you to warnings or other corrective action.</li>
	<li>Personal attacks, trolling, excessive profanity, excessive use of @ tags, and poor sportsmanship are not welcome.</li>
	<li>Recording matches is perfectly fine, posting them without checking with the opponent is not. Please make sure you're getting permission before uploading matches with other players or streaming matches.</li>
	<li>If you are linking your Twitch streams, please ensure you are advertising a MegaMan Battle Network or other MegaMan Game or obtaining Moderator Approval to do so. Any streams unrelated to MegaMan likely will be deleted. Additionally, if you are linking your Youtube videos, please ensure they are related to MegaMan.<br>
		Please be mindful of how often you are advertising your content and only do it within reason. The N1GP is not a place to be used soley for boosting your content and viewership. Furthermore, please consult moderators if you wish to plug or advertise a fangame.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>If you want to post something but are unsure whether it would violate the rules, we encourage you to Direct Message a moderator for clarification. For general questions about policy feel free to ask publicly and ping @Moderators.</p>
<p>You're encouraged to report rule violations by privately messaging a moderator. We ask that you don't publicly call for a mod to take action against a user.</p>
<p>Records of moderator actions are not publicly available. Info of this type will only be disclosed if it's for the safety of the community.</p>
