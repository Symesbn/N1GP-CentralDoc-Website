<p>Welcome to the big N1GP resource cache.</p>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ1">Q: What games are being played in the N1GP?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:125px">	
	<p>A We primarily play MegaMan Battle Network 6, the US version (BN6). Virtually any similar game that can be played online will be played on occasion though.</p>
	<p>Megaman Battle Network 6 (abbreviated to BN6) is the easiest to set up due to it supporting pvp through the wireless adaptor, which for over a decade was the only functional method of connecting over the internet.<br>
		The online pvp community was established through BN6, and it remains the premier game of the community. The Japanese version (EXE6) is occasionally used, but only when playing the Modcards format.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ2">Q: Can I play other Battle Network games online, like BN3?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>Yes. The older Battle Network games are also playable, but it should be noted that the setup process is more complicated for those games, so fewer people can play them as a result.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ3">Q: Do you guys host tournaments?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>Yes! We host BN6/EXE6 tournaments throughout the year.</p>
	<p>BN6/EXE6 is the most accessible BN game to play online. So far it's been the only BN game with enough engagement to have online tournaments ran for it.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ4">Q: What software do we use to play BN6 online?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:40px">	
	<p>Tango and Radmin. Everything you need is provided in the Resource Folder, besides game ROMs.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ5">Q: Can I play everyone on MyBoy! emulator instead of Tango?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>Some people do have MyBoy set up and ready to play, but when it comes to playing BN6 you'll need to use VBA-Link on Windows.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ6">Q: Which discord channel do I use for finding matches in BN6?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>Use the #match-making channel. To show people you want to play use the !license command first to equip the NetBattler role.<br>
		This unlocks access to the !atb command, use it in chat to temporarily equip the Available To Battle role. When you're done use !unav to remove the role.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ7">Q: How do I get started?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/ssbmars/N1GP-Community-Folder/releases/download/latest/N1GP_Community_Folder.zip">Download the Resource Folder by clicking here.</a></p>
	<p><a href="Software_Guide.php">And then follow the guide for setting up Tango</a></p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="IntroQ8">Q: Are game ROMs provided in the download? Can I ask where to get them?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>ROMs are not provided and you cannot ask for a link to download them.<br>
		Use this software to legally acquire a copy of your game by dumping it from your GBA cart with a Nintendo DS flashcart:</p>

<div class="questionBingus" style="height:100px">
	<h2 id="IntroQ9">Q: I downloaded one of the save files but it's not working. Or the save works but I can't connect to anyone else ingame. What's wrong?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>For most Battle Network games there are 3 localized versions: US, EU, & JP. Save files and pvp connections are not compatible between different localized versions.<br>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="DiscordQ1">Q: What is the #strategies channel? What kind of strategies do we discuss in there?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:100px">	
	<p>The strategies channel is meant only for BN6/EXE6 pvp discussion. Due to the high volume of pvp-centric discussion about BN6, it has its own channel.</p>
	<p>Many dedicated netbattlers wanted a place where they could discuss netbattling strategies and receive serious feedback from others.<br>
		This channel is only meant for BN6 pvp discussion. When discussing other BN games, use the general chat or the legacy-pvp channel.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="DiscordQ2">Q: What are the #legacy-pvp & #starforce-pvp channels meant for?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:175px">	
	<p>Each channel is dedicated to a subset of games that have their own setup process for playing online. Here is what each channel is dedicated to:</p>
	<p>#legacy-pvp - Battle Network 1-5 discussion and online pvp</p>
	<p>#starforce-pvp - Megaman Starforce 2 & 3 discussion and online pvp</p>
	<p>Each of these channels is dedicated to discussing the setup process for playing the games online, matchmaking, and sharing pvp strategies as well as general discussion about the games.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="DiscordQ3">Q: What's up with these roles like "Netbattler" and "Legacy Battler"?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:270">	
	<p>There are a total of 2 roles that are used to show which activities you're interested in. Here are the roles and what they mean:</p>
	<p>Netbattler - This is for BN6 online pvp players. It unlocks access to bot commands for matchmaking and Radmin/Hamachi server credentials.<br>
		It also gives permission to post and embed images in chat. You'll get pinged for event announcements such as tournaments and streams. </p>
	<p>Legacy Battler - "Legacy" refers to any of the first 5 BN games. This is a niche role for players who are participating in the more experimental method for playing online pvp in the older BN games. This role grants access to bot commands for matchmaking.</p>
	<p>All of these roles can be pinged for things that are relevant to them, such as events, matchmaking requests, or related news. By equipping any of these roles you expect that you will be pinged periodically.<br>
		You can freely equip and unequip these roles at any time by using their respective commands to toggle the role.<br>
		Read the ColonelBot page for more info on this:</p>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="DiscordQ4">Q: Any other notable roles in the Discord?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:420px">	
	<p>Yes, we have a few more roles that are worth mentioning. These roles have their own unique requirements in order to receive them.</p>
	<p>Moderators - Moderators handle administrative decisions and are responsible for keeping the streets clean. You can come to them with any questions or concerns you may have.</p>
	<p>Supporter - Supporters are involved with administrative decisions as well, but they have no responsibility for enforcing rules.<br>
		Together, moderators and supporters are often involved in helping to plan and run events for the community.</p>
	<p>Event Champion - This prestigious yellow role is reserved for players who win first place in a major tournament!</p>
	<p>Commentators - Approved members are equipped with this role to gain access to the commentary channel, where they can record live commentary during tournament streams.</p>
	<p>MOON BATTLER - This role is for players who are taking part in the current New Moon event. Moon events are casual Round Robin formats that take place more frequently than regular tournaments.</p>
	<p>MOON KEEPER - Moon Keepers update the bracket during New Moon events. Moon Battlers should report their scores in #MOON-BASE after they finish a moon battle.</p>
	<p>Millions - This decorative orange role shows that you recently made a donation to the community funds.</p>
	<p>Nitro Booster - This decorative pink role is automatically equipped when you use a Discord Nitro Boost on our server.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus" style="height:100px">
	<h2 id="DiscordQ5">Q: What are the requirements to have my Youtube or Twitch channel featured in the channel catalog on the Resources page?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:300px">	
	<p>The majority of your videos should be Battle Network pvp-related. By being included in the catalog, your channel is representing the type of content that people will expect from the N1GP.</p>
	<p>Here are the specific requirements. Supporters will use these qualifications to decide whether a new channel is eligible to be included.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>All content in your channel must uphold the Core and Etiquette rules in the N1GP.</li>
		<li>These types of videos will qualify your channel:<br>
			- vods of tournament matches or casual netbattles<br>
			- curated clips, highlight reels, commentary, informational videos<br>
			- livestreams of netbattles<br>
			- bn memes</li>
		<li>When applicable, please take advantage of Youtube playlists to make your Battle Network content easily accessible on your channel. The more non-BN videos there are in a channel, the more important it is for the BN videos to be well organized with playlists.</li>
		<li>Twitch streams can be "highlighted" to remain on twitch without expiring. Please try to highlight your pvp streams so that they'll remain watchable on twitch over a long term. We prefer channels with an existing history of viewable stream vods.</li>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q1">Q: What are the rules for BN6?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:500px">	
	<p>Battle Network 6 is a well balanced game and as a result there are very few rules to observe. These rules relate more to sportsmanship and cheat prevention than to the game itself.</p>
	<p>There are various formats which use unique rules, but the following rules will always be true regardless of the format, unless a format's rules explicitly state otherwise.<br>
		Here are the universal rules:</p>
	<p>1) Chips unabtainable without hacking are strictly banned. This applies to giga chips from the opposite version of the one you choose to play. For BN6, this also applies to these Japanese-exclusive chips that were removed from the game:</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/018.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/153.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/275.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/278.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/311.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/312.png">
	<img src="Images/FAQ/313.png">
	<p>(A pvp-ready save file is available for both versions of BN6 and EXE6. These save files do not contain any infringing chips.)</p>
	<p>2) Using cheats to change any values in the game is banned. Using any features resembling auto-fire or turbo controls is not permitted.</p>
	<p>The "Disable Music" gameshark code is allowed. This is the only exception outside of special formats that explicitly allow or require the use of specific cheatcodes.</p>
	<p>3) While playing online, sometimes the game can desync and invalidate the match. Tournament games that ended in a desync are to be replayed. Purposely disconnecting or causing a desync in an attempt to invalidate a match is strictly prohibited.</p>
	<p>4) At the request of either player, the host of a match will be determined by a digital coin flip. If a technical problem prevents a player from being able to host, it is requested that their situation be respected.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q2">Q: What are BN6 tournaments like?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>Participants check in to a channel only visible to them. During the tournament, each participant records video of their tourney matches and then submits them to the organizer afterwards.<br>
		At a later date, a curated selection of matches from each round of the tournament is played on stream. The results of the tournament are revealed during the stream. Prior to the stream, participants aren't supposed to reveal who won the tournament.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q3">Q: What does the EXE6 patch do?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus">	
	<p>It translates the game UI to English while maintaining compatibility with the unpatched Japanese EXE6 game. The patch is available in the Resource Folder.</p>
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q4">Q: Why do people sometimes play the Japanese EXE6 version?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:175px">	
	<p>The Japanese version (EXE6) supports Modcards, which were removed in the English release (BN6). BN6 contains numerous bugfixes which improve gameplay, so we only play EXE6 if we're going to use Modcards.</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkcWoDcwZY7qrJi-qAgN1JxAzmupe0-E7a3igcir4_U/edit">To learn more about the Modcards format, click here to read the Modcards guide.</a></p>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q5">Q: What are the notable formats for BN6?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:2250px">	
	<p>There are many fun ways to play BN6 (and EXE6). Here are all the notable formats we play in the N1GP community.</p>
	<p>BN6 (Standard)<br>The version is USA BN6. This is the standard format played in the N1GP.</p>
	
	<p>EXE6 Modcards</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/ModCards_s.png">
	<p>Known as "Master Class" in Japan, this format uses Modcards with an 80MB limit. All of the JP-exclusive chips are permitted, including DoubleBeast and the Cybeast Gigachips.<br>
		Some glitches related to Modcards are banned. Read more about it in the Modcards Guide.</p>
		
	<p>EXE6 Double Navi</p>
	<p>This alternative take on Modcards allows for only cards based on navis to be used. Only 2 modcards can be equipped, but there is no enforced MB limit.<br>
		This format leads to some unique strategies that you wouldn't see elsewhere. This was conceived by the user Nugget.</p>
		
	<p>EXE6 Seniors</p>
	<p>This is the Japanese format in which Modcards are prohibited. All the Japanese-exclusive chips are allowed. This format is rarely played in the N1GP.</p>
	
	<p>BN6 Link Navis</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/NEEDFORLINK_s.png">
	<p>This format uses cheatcodes to play as different navis from BN6. These navis have innate abilities, but lack a navicust.<br>
		Playing as Megaman is not allowed in this format.</p>
		
	<p>BN6 Eurandom</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/Eurandom2020_s.png">
	<p>This format simulates Random Battles, but uses the TripleBattle mode so there's less downtime between matches. The tournament organizer uses RNG to simulate how the game creates a random folder,<br>
		then creates and distributes a savestate with a manually crafted random folder for players to load and play with. This was created by and named after the user Eurasia M.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both the navicust and folder are predetermined. The Reg and Tag chips are the only aspect of the save that can be edited.</li>
		<li>Only chips with 30 MB or less may be set as Regular chips. For Tag chips the normal rules apply.</li>
		<li>Everyone uses the same version of BN6. Crosses and Beastout are banned.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Pool Party</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/poolparty_s.png">
	<p>A restricted format in which players must create folders using a limited set, or "pool" of chips, and the Navi Customizer is restricted to the visible 5x5 space.<br>
		Tournaments in this style reward creativity and folder building skills using limited resources, as well as a different flavor of play. This format is the brainchild of the user Shadow.
		Full document is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ikUJSJ6VasD0ynGuBknIyChlw_zuIE5ZuIDfc5c5xE/edit">Here</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Past pools contain 50 standard and 7 mega chips. Gigas and SP Navis were omitted from the pools.</li>
		<li>Chips are limited to three copies even if MB allows for additional copies.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Freaky Friday</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/freakyfriday_s.png">
	<p>Players in this format receive two setups (Version, Folder, Navi Customizer) randomly selected from a previous NEW MOON cycle. One is chosen to lock in to play for the week.<br>
		Similar to Random Battles, but the pool of potential setups expands with each NEW MOON tournament. Make sure to participate in NEW MOON so your folders will show up too!</p>

	<p>Infinite Beast</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/InfiniteBeast2022s.png">
	<p>A format in which all participants are permanently in Beast Out using a special GameShark code, provided by Prof. 9. The nature of permanent Beast Out means:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Mega Buster, and Cross Charges are unavailable, outside of BugRiseSword and BugDeathThunder.</li>
		<li>Beast Over Status is inaccessible.</li>
		<li>Permanent access to Beast Jump on applicable chips for intense chip slinging action!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>All-Stars</p>
	<img src="Images/FAQ/allstarslogo.png">
	<p>A format that employs a romhack to allow players to equip crosses from either version of BN6. Of the 10 available crosses to choose from, players can mix and match a selection of any 5 crosses to use in battle.<br>
		Players still choose whether to play the Falzar or Gregar version. This patch was made by LuckyTyphlosion.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When equipping a cross from the opposite version while in Beast Out, MegaMan's Beast form will switch versions to match the cross's.<br>
			The bonus abilities granted by Beast Out will immediately change to match the new version whenever this happens.</li>
		<li>During tournaments, a player's choice of crosses is locked in and submitted as part of their loadout along with Chip folder and NaviCust. </li>
	</ul>	
</div>

<div class="questionBingus">
	<h2 id="BN6Q6">Q: What's the strongest folder in BN6?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:175px">	
	<p>BN6 has no unbeatable builds. There are some popular strong builds that you'll need to be aware of, but remember that everything has counterplay and nothing is the definitive best strategy.</p>
	<p>You can view a list of the builds used by previous event champions to get started:</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>This section gives detailed instructions on solving specific known issues.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="FAQ.php">I downloaded one of the save files but it's not working. Or the save works but I can't connect to anyone else ingame. What's wrong?</a></li>
	<li><a href="FAQ.php">Tango Issues?</a></li>
</ul>


<div class="questionBingus" style="height:100px">
	<h2>Q: I downloaded one of the save files but it's not working. Or the save works but I can't connect to anyone else ingame. What's wrong?</h2>
</div>

<div class="contentBingus" style="height:420px">	
	<p>For most Battle Network games there are 3 localized versions: US, EU, & JP. Save files and pvp connections are not compatible between different localized versions.</p>
	<p>If you can't load the save file, it's likely because you have the wrong version of the game. If you can't connect to anyone else, it's likely for the same reason.</p>
	<p>Make sure you're not trying to load a Japanese save file in the English version, or vice versa. If you're sure both the save file and game are the English version, the problem may be that you're using the EU game.<br>
		The EU version cannot load our saves or connect to the US version. You want to use the US version.</p>
	<p>How to know which regional version you have:</p>
	<p>For BN6, check the title screen of the game to see which version it is. The US version will have an “&#x24C7” symbol right after "BATTLE NETWORK", while the EU version will have a “™” symbol.<br>
		If you have the EU version, you will need to use the ROM from the proper cart. If you only have access to the EU cart, then you can convert your ROM to the US version with the help of a patch.</p>
	<p>The "BN6 EU to US" Patch is available in the Resource Folder and is included in the main download. Follow the directions in the readme file for specific instructions on how to use it.</p>
	<p>If you successfully loaded a save file but are still failing to connect to anyone else, make sure you did not accidentally use EXE6 while connecting to someone who is playing BN6. The US version cannot connect with the JP version.<br>
		The translation patch for the JP version does not affect the connection compatibility. If you're certain you're using the correct version, then the connection problem is being caused by a different issue.</p>
